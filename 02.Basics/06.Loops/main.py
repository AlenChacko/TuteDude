# Loops let you repeat code without writing it many times
# without a loop
print("Hello")
print("Hello")
print("Hello")
print("Hello")
print("Hello")
# with a loop
for i in range(5):
    print("Hello")

# Two main loops in python
# while -> repeats when a condition is True
# for -> repeat over a sequence like list,dict,set,range,string etc
