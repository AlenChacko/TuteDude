**What are Literals in Python?**
    A literal is a fixed value that you directly write into your Python code.
    10
    "Hello"
    35.6
    True
    None

**Why are Literals Important?**
    They are the raw data Python works with.
    Variables store data, but literals are the data itself.
    Without literals, code can’t represent values like numbers, text, or Boolean results.

**Types of Literals in Python**
    *1. Numeric Literals*
        Interger -> -5,0,5
        Float -> -5.7, 5.7
        Complex -> 3+4j
    *2. String Literals*
        "Hello", 'Hello', """Hello""", '''Hello'''
    *3. Boolean Literals*
        True, False
    *4. Special Literal*
        None
    *5. Collection Literals (Very Important)*
        | Type           | Literal Example               |
        | -------------- | ----------------------------- |
        | **List**       | `[1, 2, 3]`                   |
        | **Tuple**      | `(10, 20, 30)`                |
        | **Dictionary** | `{"name": "Alen", "age": 22}` |
        | **Set**        | `{10, 20, 30}`                |

**Memory Behavior of Literals (Advanced Concept)**
    Python optimizes literals to save memory:
    Small integers are interned (cached)
    Strings may also be cached
    Repeated literals may point to the same memory block

**How Python Treats Literals Internally (Behind-the-scenes)**
    When Python sees a literal like "Hello" or 20,it creates an object in memory.
    Variables are only references to these objects.
    Literals are created at compile time.

**Differance between Literals and Variables**
    |      Literals            | Variables            |
    | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
    | Actual fixed values | Names pointing to values |
    | Cannot change       | Can change value         |
    | Written directly    | Assigned using `=`       |
