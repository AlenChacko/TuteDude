**How Python works?**
*Step-1 Write your code*
    print("Hello World")

*Step-2 Python Interprets the code*
    This means it   reads and runs your code.

*Step-3 Internal Process*
    Python has:
    *Interpreter* -> Runs code step by step
    *Parcer* -> Checks syntax
    *ByteCode Compailer* -> Converts code into bytecode(.pyc)
    *PVM (Python Virtual Machine)* -> Executes the bytecode

**How Python Virtual Machine (PVM) works?**
    *PVM Execution* -> The PVM iterates through the bytecode instructions and translate each instructions into specific machine code that computer CPU can understand.
    *Runtime Environment* -> The PVM handles all the essential services including memory management(using its garbage collector) and making system calls like reading files and interacting with OS
