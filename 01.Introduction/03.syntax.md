**Python Syntax Rules**
    *Indentation* -> 
        Python uses indentation for defining code blocks, unlike many languages that use braces({})
        It is used for function bodies,loops,conditional statements and classes.
        The standard is 4 spaces per indentation level.
    *Statements and new-lines* ->
        Each logical statements typically ends with a new line.
        A ";" isn't needed unless you put multiple statments in a single line(Not recommented)
    *Line continuation* ->
        To break a long line use "\" or () {}
    *Variables* ->
    They are created at the moment when value is assigned.
    No need for declare a type of variable in python



**Expression vs Statement**
    print("Hello) is a statement, it is a complete command
    20+10 is a statement, something that produces a value
